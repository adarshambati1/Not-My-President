## A Logistic Regression Audio Classifier for AI-generated Speech

### Introduction

  One afternoon, Jennifer DeStefano’s phone rang with an unknown caller id. To her dismay, when she
picked up, the voice was her daughter’s, Brianna crying. A man’s voice in the background threatened
to kidnap and kill her unless a $1 million was sent over as ransom. Only after a number of 911 calls
and an ultimately successful attempt to reach her daughter, that this call was exposed as a scam.
The scam artist had scraped Brianna’s private TikTok and public Instagram accounts to create a
hyper-realistic audio simulation of her voice. It was only due to the quick-thinking of Jennifer that
this scam was revealed [Karl ].
  This whole incident simply reveals how dangerous AI-generated audio can be, especially now that
large language models and a growing database of human speech via social media platforms are greatly
augmenting the realism of such speech.
  It is not unreasonable to imagine that the future of scamming, espionage, or sabotage will heavily
rely on AI-generated audio. To that end, I recognize that those committed to solving the problem of
AI-content classification will always be playing catch up to those building generative models. However,
this research project is a simple example that demonstrates that in the status quo, AI-generated audio
still remains distinguishable from human speech. As generated speech develops further. larger, more
complex neural nets are likely needed to discern artificially generated audio.

### About this Model
This model is a simple logistic regression audio classifier. It is based on dhruvesh13's Audio-Genre-Classification: https://github.com/dhruvesh13/Audio-Genre-Classification
